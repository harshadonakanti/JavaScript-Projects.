# JSProject
    Simon Says is a fun memory game where the player has to follow a sequence of colors shown by the game. Each round, the game adds a new step to the sequence, and the player must repeat the entire sequence correctly to move to the next round. If the player makes a mistake, the game is over. The goal is to remember and repeat the longest sequence possible.

# GuessGame( Guess the number)
    This is a simple Guess Number Game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a chosen range. The game prompts the player to guess the number and gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low. The player can type "Quit" to exit the game at any time. When the player guesses the correct number, a congratulatory message is displayed on the webpage.

# EventListeners(Activity)
    This Activity is a Random Colour Generator. When you click the "Generate random colour" button, the background color of the display area changes to a randomly generated RGB color, and the hex color code is shown as the page heading. It offers a fun way to experiment with different colors dynamically using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project also uses Bootstrap to style the button for a clean and modern look.
# KeyDown(Activity)
    This Activity listens for keyboard key presses and displays the key pressed on the screen in large text. When the spacebar is pressed, it shows "Spc" instead of a blank space. The background is styled dark with the key shown in a bright color, making it visually clear which key was pressed. This is a simple demonstration of handling keyboard events in JavaScript.
